# LordCommander

### Future Improvements

- [x] Add counter for successful runs and failed runs
- [x] Count directories
- [x] One instance of LordCommander for all projects
- [x] Show index in search result. e.g. (`./lc utils search demo //Found! (Index: 3)`)
- [x] Specify indices to exclude during a command execution. e.g. (`./lc run pwd --ex=3,5`)
- [x] Fixing foreground colors for light color schemes
- [ ] ~~A way to write output log.~~

***These things may or may not be implemented.*
