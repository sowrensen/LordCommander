# LordCommander

LordCommander is a command line program to run a shell command recursively through predefined
directories.

Running
-----

Clone the repository with the same directory level where you want to run 
recursive commands. Run following commands to clone the repository and 
install dependencies:

```
git clone https://sowrensen@github.com/sowrensen/lordcommander.git
cd lordcommander
pipenv install
chmod +x lc
./lc <command> <args> <flags>
```

Usage
-----

You can append `--help` after each command always to see the manual.

### Directory Handling

#### See directory list

```
./lc dirs view
```

This will show all saved directory names as their insertion order. To sort directory names alphabetically,
append `sort`  or `--sort` after list.

```
./lc dirs view [sort|--sort]
```

#### Adding directories

```
./lc dirs add [dir1 dir2 dir3...]
```

All the directory names after `add` keyword will be appended to the directory list.

#### Removing directories

```
./lc dirs clear [dir1 dir2 dir3...]
```

Add desired directory names after `clear` to remove them from list. However, you can also clear the entire list
of directories if you specify `--full` after `clear`.

```
./lc dirs clear --full
```

It will ask for your confirmation, if you allow, it will remove the entire list of directories.

-----

### Running Commands

Running a command throughout the saved directories is easy. Here's an example:

```
./lc run pwd
```

That's it! It will recursively run for each saved directories and show the output. 
Afterwards, you will see the number of successful and failed runs. 

> **Note:** If your command is more than one word, you have to wrap it around with 
> single or double quote. An example can be `./lc run 'git status'`. 

#### Throttled execution

Now, if you have a huge list of directories and you don't want to run the command altogether, 
you can slice them by indices (I assume that you're familiar with how array or list index works). 
If you run `./lc run --help` you will see two flags `--li` and `--ui` respectively for 
**lower index** and **upper index**. So if you decide to run a command only to first 
50 directories, you can simply specify `--li=0` and `--ui=50`. Or even simpler, 
just mention `--ui=50`, it will run throughout index 0 to index 49 anyway.

```
./lc run <command> --li=0 --ui=50
```

or,

```
./lc run <command> 0 50
```

or,

```
./lc run <command> --ui=50
```

So for running the rest? I bet you already figured that out,

```
./lc run <command> --li=50
```

or,
```
./lc run <command> 50
```

Yes, you don't have to remember or know how any items are in your list. Just tell the program to 
run it from 50 and it will start right there and won't stop until it reaches the end of the list. 

-----

### Utilities 

From version 3.0, a utility class has been added to run some handy tasks. Right now there are two 
commands, more will be introduced over time.

#### Searching for a directory

Forgot if a directory name has already been included or not? Just tell the program to look for it, 
it will tell you if it is there or not.

```
./lc utils search <directory_name>
```

> **Note**: It is case sensitive, so if you have a directory named `ABC` and your search string 
> is `abc`, you will get a negative result.

#### Seeing total number of directories

If you're wondering how many saved directories do you have, just tell LordCommander to count them for you:

```
./lc utils total
```

Future Improvements
-----

** These may or may not be implemented.

- ~~Add counter for successful runs and failed runs.~~ ‚úîÔ∏è
- ~~Count directories.~~ ‚úîÔ∏è
- One instance of LordCommander for all projects.
- Use SQLite3 instead of Shelve.
